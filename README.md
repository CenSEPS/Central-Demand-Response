# Central-Demand-Response
This repository represents the source code for a residential-power-system modeling testbed. The purpose of this testbed 
is to facilitate the design of 'smart' loads which can adjust their power usage based on AC mains frequency. Ultimately,
these loads will not need a centralized controller to send them regulation signals.

# Hardware for central computer
TS-7250-v2 from Technologic Systems running Debian.
